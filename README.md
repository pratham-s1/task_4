This was the fourth task of my internship, where I created a simple responsive HTML page and applied media queries to adapt the layout for smaller screens. I ensured that fixed-width sections and horizontal layouts (like two columns and nav menus) stack vertically on screens smaller than 768px. I also made sure images scale within their containers and fixed any overflow issues. Using Chrome DevTools, I tested how the layout behaves across various screen sizes. This task helped me better understand the importance of responsive design and how to apply it using CSS media queries.
